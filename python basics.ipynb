    "  EXPLAIN THE KEY FEATURES OF PYTHON THAT MAKE IT A POPULAR CHOICE FOR PROGRAMMING\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Easy to Learn: Python has a simple syntax and is relatively easy to learn, making it a great language for beginners. Its often taught as a first language in introductory programming courses.\n",
    "2. High-Level Language: Python is a high-level language, meaning it abstracts away many low-level details, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their program without worrying about memory management, etc.\n",
    "3. Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language, which means that code is executed line by line, making it easy to write and test code quickly.\n",
    "4. Object-Oriented: Python is an object-oriented language, which organizes code into objects that contain data and functions that operate on that data.\n",
    "5. Large Standard Library: Python has a vast and comprehensive standard library that includes modules for various tasks, such as file I/O, networking, and data structures.\n",
    "6. Dynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed, which means you dont need to declare variable types before using them. This makes it easy to write code quickly and experiment with different data types.\n",
    "7. Cross-Platform: Python can run on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n",
    "8. Extensive Community: Python has a large and active community, which means there are many resources available, including libraries, frameworks, and tutorials.\n",
    "9. Rapid Development: Python syntax and nature make it ideal for rapid prototyping and development."

    "Type casting/ type conversion >> The process of changing the data type of a value/ objects\n",
    "\n",

    "There are two types of typecasting in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implicit Typecasting\n",
    "Implicit typecasting is done automatically by Python when a value of one type is assigned to a variable of another type. For example:\n",

    "In this example, Python automatically converts the integer a to a float when adding it to the float b.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explicit Typecasting\n",
    "Explicit typecasting is done using built-in functions such as int(), float(), str(), etc. to convert a value of one type to another type. For example:\n",
